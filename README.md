# Inventory Manager

An internal inventory, invoice, and project-component tracking system with AI-assisted
invoice extraction (Google Gemini — free tier), built with Next.js (App Router), Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, API routes)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- **File storage:** Vercel Blob (invoice document uploads)
- **AI extraction:** Google Gemini (free tier available, no card required) for reading invoice images/PDFs
- **UI:** React 19, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, TanStack Query/Table

## Local development

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables** — copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:
   - `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` — a PostgreSQL database (see [Database setup](#database-setup))
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` — a Vercel Blob token (see [File storage setup](#file-storage-setup))
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` — optional; without it, invoice upload still works but skips AI auto-extraction. Get a free key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

3. **Push the schema and seed sample data**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   npm run db:seed   # optional — adds sample suppliers/products/invoices
   ```

4. **Run the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000

## Database setup

This project needs a real PostgreSQL database — it will **not** work with SQLite on
Vercel (serverless filesystems are ephemeral and read-only in production).

Recommended: **Neon** (serverless Postgres), connected via the Vercel Marketplace
integration — this auto-populates the right environment variables in your Vercel
project, including a pooled connection for the app and a direct connection for
schema pushes. See [Deploying to Vercel](#deploying-to-vercel) below for exact steps.

## File storage setup

Invoice documents (images/PDFs) are stored in **Vercel Blob**, not on disk — Vercel's
serverless functions don't share or persist a local filesystem across requests.
Connect a Blob store to your Vercel project (see below) and `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
is injected automatically.

## Deploying to Vercel

See the full step-by-step deployment guide (GitHub push, Vercel project setup,
database + blob storage provisioning, environment variables, and post-deploy
verification) provided separately by your Claude conversation, or ask Claude to
regenerate it — the key steps are:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Import the repo in Vercel.
3. Add the **Neon** integration (Storage tab) → auto-fills `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL` / etc.
4. Add a **Blob store** (Storage tab) → auto-fills `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`.
5. Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` manually (Settings → Environment Variables) — get a free key at aistudio.google.com/apikey.
6. Deploy. Vercel runs `prisma generate && prisma db push && next build` automatically.
